## Description

Remove 'get proton family' button and improve the placement of the mail label

### Main feature

- Remove 'get proton family' button
- Move the label just to the right of the sender name
- A setting page where you can choose to use one option, both or nothing at all
- The addon is only executed on the proton.me subdomain

### History

I always wanted to make a firefox extension for a long time and now I have two excuses for it:
- I pay proton and I'm not a fan of the "get a new plan" button everywhere because of it.
- As I use the label to sort my mail, I find it more readable to have the label just to the right of the sender's name.

## Installation

### Requirement

We just require the authorization to store the settings you choose into your sync storage via `storage.sync[set | get]`[^1].

Firefox needs a manual approval and chrome seems not.

### Firefox
- [Download the extension for Firefox](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/improveproton/)
- Go to mail.proton.me or any other proton.me subdomain and authorize the addon

<summary>See the screenshot here for more details</summary>

</details>

### Chrome & Chrome based browser
- Since I need a developer account for chrome and the registration has a 5 dollar fee, I haven't put the addon on the store yet 
- At the moment, if you want to have this addon on chrome, you must download the latest version (see the latest zip file) [and follow these instructions](https://superuser.com/questions/247651/how-does-one-install-an-extension-for-chrome-browser-from-the-local-file-system).

## Configuration
